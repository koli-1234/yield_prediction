# Yield Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict crop yields using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate yield predictions to help farmers make informed decisions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Yield prediction

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yield_prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
